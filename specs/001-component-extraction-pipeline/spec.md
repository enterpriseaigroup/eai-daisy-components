# Feature Specification: Component Extraction Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `001-component-extraction-pipeline`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This repo serves as the public distribution channel for design system components from your private design-system repository (the Configurator). It's essentially a component library extraction and publishing pipeline."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Component Developer Extracts Components (Priority: P1)

A component developer needs to extract reusable UI components from DAISY v1 and Configurator repositories, strip proprietary business logic, and publish them as standalone npm packages that other developers can use in their projects.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the repository - creating a public component library from private design systems. Without this, the repository serves no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a single component from DAISY v1, running the extraction process, and successfully publishing it as an npm package that works independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a component exists in DAISY v1 repository, **When** developer runs extraction pipeline, **Then** component is extracted with clean public API and no proprietary code
2. **Given** an extracted component, **When** published to npm, **Then** external developers can install and use it without access to private repositories
3. **Given** a component with internal dependencies, **When** extracted, **Then** dependencies are either bundled, made configurable, or abstracted away

### User Story 2 - External Developer Consumes Components (Priority: P2)

An external developer wants to discover, install, and use components from the EAI Daisy component library in their React/Vue applications with complete TypeScript support and clear documentation.

**Why this priority**: Component adoption depends on developer experience. Poor documentation or APIs will result in low adoption regardless of component quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new React project, installing a published component, and successfully implementing it using only the public documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a published component, **When** developer searches npm, **Then** component appears with clear description and usage examples
2. **Given** component documentation, **When** developer follows setup instructions, **Then** component renders correctly in their application
3. **Given** TypeScript project, **When** developer imports component, **Then** full type safety and IntelliSense support is available

---

### User Story 3 - Design System Team Maintains Sync (Priority: P3)

The design system team needs to keep the public component library synchronized with updates from DAISY v1 and Configurator while managing version compatibility and breaking changes.

**Why this priority**: Long-term sustainability requires automated synchronization. Manual processes don't scale and lead to drift between private and public versions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by updating a component in DAISY v1, triggering the sync process, and verifying the public version receives appropriate updates with correct versioning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** component update in DAISY v1, **When** sync process runs, **Then** public component receives update with appropriate semantic version bump
2. **Given** breaking change in private component, **When** extracted to public, **Then** migration guide is generated and major version is incremented
3. **Given** new component in Configurator, **When** marked for extraction, **Then** component appears in extraction queue with dependency analysis

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a component has deep dependencies on proprietary services or APIs?
- How does the system handle components that use internal design tokens or themes?
- What happens when DAISY v1 and Configurator have conflicting versions of the same component?
- How are components handled that require authentication or user context?
- What happens when extracted components have circular dependencies?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST extract UI components from DAISY v1 repository while preserving component interfaces and functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove all proprietary business logic, internal API calls, and organization-specific configurations from extracted components
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate TypeScript definitions for all extracted components with complete prop interfaces
- **FR-004**: System MUST create comprehensive documentation including API reference, usage examples, and accessibility guidelines for each component
- **FR-005**: System MUST package components as npm modules with appropriate shadcn/ui and elevenlabs dependencies
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement semantic versioning with automated version management based on change types
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide automated testing pipeline including unit tests, accessibility audits, and visual regression tests
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate usage examples and storybook documentation for each component
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate component independence by testing in isolated environments
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain compatibility matrix between public components and their private source versions
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide CI/CD pipeline for automated extraction, testing, and publishing to npm
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate migration guides when breaking changes occur between component versions

### Key Entities

- **Component**: Reusable UI element with defined props interface, extracted from private repositories, published as npm package
- **Extraction Job**: Process instance that extracts specific components, including source analysis, cleanup, and packaging steps
- **Version Mapping**: Relationship between private component versions and their corresponding public package versions
- **Dependency Graph**: Network of component relationships and external dependencies that must be resolved during extraction
- **Publication Package**: Final npm-ready package including component code, documentation, tests, and metadata

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Components can be extracted and published with zero manual code modification within 15 minutes per component
- **SC-002**: External developers can successfully install and implement any component within 10 minutes using only public documentation
- **SC-003**: 100% of extracted components pass automated independence validation (no private repository dependencies)
- **SC-004**: Component library achieves 95% test coverage including unit, integration, and accessibility tests
- **SC-005**: Documentation generation produces complete API reference and examples for 100% of component props and methods
- **SC-006**: Version synchronization between private and public components maintains <24 hour lag for non-breaking changes
- **SC-007**: Breaking change detection achieves 100% accuracy with automated migration guide generation
- **SC-008**: Component bundle sizes remain under 50KB gzipped for 90% of components to ensure performance
- **SC-009**: TypeScript integration provides complete type safety with zero 'any' types in public interfaces
- **SC-010**: 90% of component extractions complete successfully without manual intervention or error handling

## Assumptions

- DAISY v1 and Configurator repositories use standard React component patterns
- Components follow consistent prop interface conventions across repositories
- shadcn/ui and elevenlabs provide sufficient base component functionality
- Target applications will use modern React (16.8+) with hooks support
- npm registry will be the primary distribution channel
- External consumers will primarily use TypeScript or JavaScript with modern build tools
- Component extraction can be automated through static analysis and AST transformation
- Private repositories contain clear component boundaries without excessive coupling
