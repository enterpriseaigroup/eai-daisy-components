# Feature Specification: Enhanced Documentation Platform

**Feature Branch**: `003-fumadocs-storybook-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enhanced documentation platform with dual Storybook and Fumadocs integration using ElevenLabs UI components foundation for professional NPM package documentation"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: How should V2 components be uniquely identified and versioned across the system? → A: Semantic versioning (semver) with automatic synchronization across platforms
- Q: How should the documentation site handle loading errors, missing components, or build failures? → A: Graceful degradation with fallback messaging and partial functionality
- Q: What's the expected maximum number of V2 components the system should support? → A: Small library (10-25 components) optimized for simplicity
- Q: What's the specific strategy for resolving conflicts between shadcn/ui and ElevenLabs UI styling? → A: CSS namespace isolation with scoped styling for each foundation library
- Q: What standardized format should V2 components use for NPM packaging and distribution? → A: ES modules with TypeScript definitions and tree-shaking support

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Storybook Component Development Platform (Priority: P1)

As a V2 component developer, I need an interactive Storybook environment where I can develop, test, and showcase visual-only components built on shadcn/ui and ElevenLabs UI foundation, so I can iterate quickly on component designs while maintaining visual consistency with reference DAISY v1 components.

**Why this priority**: Essential foundation for all component development work - enables developers to build and test components before any documentation concerns.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new V2 component, viewing it in Storybook, and validating it renders correctly with proper controls for component props.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have DAISY v1 reference components in `/daisyv1/`, **When** I create a new V2 component using shadcn/ui + ElevenLabs foundation, **Then** I can view and interact with it in Storybook
2. **Given** I'm developing a V2 component, **When** I modify component props in Storybook, **Then** I can see real-time visual feedback and compare against DAISY v1 reference
3. **Given** I complete a V2 component, **When** I run Storybook build, **Then** the component is properly documented with all prop controls and examples

---

### User Story 2 - Professional Fumadocs Documentation Site (Priority: P2)

As an NPM package consumer, I need a professional documentation website with ElevenLabs-style design that showcases available V2 components, provides installation instructions, and demonstrates usage patterns, so I can quickly discover and integrate components into my projects.

**Why this priority**: Drives adoption of NPM packages and provides professional face for the component library, but depends on having components from P1.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the documentation site, browsing component examples, and following installation/usage instructions to integrate a component.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** V2 components exist, **When** I visit the Fumadocs documentation site, **Then** I see a professional interface similar to ElevenLabs UI docs with component galleries
2. **Given** I'm on the documentation site, **When** I select a component, **Then** I see detailed documentation with live examples, props tables, and copy-paste installation commands
3. **Given** I want to use a component, **When** I follow the documentation instructions, **Then** I can successfully install and integrate the component into my React project

---

### User Story 3 - Integrated Component Foundation (Priority: P1)

As a component developer, I need access to both standard shadcn/ui components and ElevenLabs UI components as my foundation layer, so I can create V2 components that leverage proven design patterns while maintaining consistency with modern audio/AI interface standards.

**Why this priority**: Critical foundation requirement that enables all component development - without proper foundation components, no V2 components can be built.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by importing both shadcn/ui and ElevenLabs UI components into a new component and verifying they work together seamlessly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm creating a new V2 component, **When** I import shadcn/ui primitives (Button, Dialog, etc.), **Then** they integrate properly with my component setup
2. **Given** I need audio/AI-specific functionality, **When** I import ElevenLabs UI components (Audio Player, Waveform, etc.), **Then** they work alongside shadcn/ui components
3. **Given** I combine both foundation layers, **When** I build my V2 component, **Then** styling and theming remain consistent across all foundation components

---

### User Story 4 - NPM Package Documentation Generation (Priority: P3)

As a component maintainer, I need automated documentation generation that creates beautiful NPM package docs with the same look and feel as ElevenLabs UI docs, so I can maintain professional documentation without manual effort.

**Why this priority**: Important for long-term maintainability and professional appearance, but not blocking for initial component development.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a component change, running documentation generation, and verifying the resulting docs reflect the updates with proper styling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I update a V2 component's props or examples, **When** I run the documentation build process, **Then** the Fumadocs site automatically reflects the changes
2. **Given** I have component TypeScript interfaces, **When** documentation is generated, **Then** prop tables are automatically created from the type definitions
3. **Given** I want to publish documentation, **When** I deploy to GitHub Pages, **Then** the site maintains ElevenLabs-style design with proper navigation and search

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a V2 component conflicts with both shadcn/ui and ElevenLabs UI component names?
- How does the system handle version mismatches between shadcn/ui and ElevenLabs UI dependencies?
- What happens when Storybook and Fumadocs generate conflicting static assets?
- How does the system handle components that require both audio/visual capabilities and standard UI interactions?
- What happens when ElevenLabs UI components are updated and break our V2 component implementations?
- System provides graceful degradation with fallback messaging when documentation site encounters loading errors, missing components, or build failures
