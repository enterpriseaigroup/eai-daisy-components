# Specification Validation Checklist: 004-v2-getaddress-component

**Generated**: 2025-01-22  
**Spec File**: `/Users/douglaswross/Code/eai/eai-daisy-components/.specify/specs/004-v2-getaddress-component/spec.md`

## âœ… Mandatory Section Completeness

- [x] **User Scenarios & Testing**: 4 user stories defined with priorities (P1-P3)
- [x] **Requirements**: 12 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-012) + 5 key entities
- [x] **Success Criteria**: 8 measurable outcomes (SC-001 to SC-008)
- [x] **Edge Cases**: 5 edge cases documented
- [x] **Implementation Assumptions**: 6 assumptions documented

## âœ… No Implementation Details

**Validation**: Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW.

- [x] No specific technology mentioned for business logic implementation
- [x] Requirements are technology-agnostic (TypeScript/React mentioned only for build/compile context, not business logic)
- [x] Pseudo-code format is described as output artifact, not implementation approach
- [x] API integration described as behavior (session validation, error handling), not specific code patterns
- [x] Component structure described as file organization (README, tests, src), not code architecture

**Exceptions**: Acceptable technology references for context:

- âœ… Configurator SDK v2.1.0+ (required dependency specified in feature context)
- âœ… TypeScript 5.0+ strict mode (build toolchain for validation)
- âœ… React 18+ (framework context from existing project)
- âœ… shadcn/ui (UI library specified in project requirements)
- âœ… Sequence 2 FastAPI architecture (external API context, not this feature's implementation)

## âœ… Testable & Unambiguous Requirements

**Validation**: All requirements have clear pass/fail criteria.

**FR-001**: "Pipeline MUST generate a valid V2 component file that compiles without errors"

- âœ… **Testable**: Run TypeScript compiler on generated file, check exit code = 0
- âœ… **Unambiguous**: "compiles without errors" is binary (0 errors = pass)

**FR-003**: "Generated pseudo-code MUST describe the Public API integration pattern"

- âœ… **Testable**: Parse generated pseudo-code, check for keywords: "session", "FastAPI proxy", "/api/v1/proxy", "APIM", "429"
- âœ… **Unambiguous**: Specific pattern elements listed (session-based auth, proxy endpoint, APIM error handling)

**FR-005**: "Generator MUST analyze baseline to identify business logic patterns"

- âœ… **Testable**: Compare baseline source code to generated pseudo-code, verify validation rules/transforms captured
- âœ… **Unambiguous**: Specific patterns defined (validation rules, data transformations, conditional rendering)

**FR-011**: "Pipeline MUST support dry-run mode"

- âœ… **Testable**: Run command with --dry-run flag, verify no files created and output preview shown
- âœ… **Unambiguous**: Clear behavior (preview without file creation)

**All 12 FRs validated**: âœ… Testable and unambiguous

## âœ… Measurable Success Criteria

**Validation**: All success criteria are quantifiable and technology-agnostic.

**SC-001**: "Developer can generate component in under 30 seconds"

- âœ… **Measurable**: Time command execution (< 30s = pass)
- âœ… **Technology-agnostic**: Time-based metric, no implementation assumptions

**SC-002**: "Generated component passes TypeScript compilation with zero errors"

- âœ… **Measurable**: Count compiler errors (0 = pass)
- âœ… **Technology-agnostic**: Outcome-based (compiles), not process-based

**SC-003**: "Pseudo-code contains at least 15 specific business logic statements"

- âœ… **Measurable**: Count non-placeholder statements (â‰¥ 15 = pass)
- âœ… **Technology-agnostic**: Statement count, not code complexity

**SC-005**: "Developer can implement component in 4 hours or less"

- âœ… **Measurable**: Track implementation time with timer (< 4hrs = pass)
- âœ… **Technology-agnostic**: User productivity metric, not technical metric

**SC-008**: "90% of developers confirm pseudo-code accuracy"

- âœ… **Measurable**: Survey 3 developers, calculate agreement rate (â‰¥ 90% = pass)
- âœ… **Technology-agnostic**: User validation metric

**All 8 SCs validated**: âœ… Measurable and technology-agnostic

## âœ… Clarification Markers

**Validation**: Max 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers with suggested answers.

**Count**: 3 clarification markers (within limit âœ…)

1. **Output Location**: `packages/v2-components/` vs `src/components/`
   - âœ… Suggested default provided: `packages/v2-components/src/`
   - âœ… Rationale explained: "keep V2 components isolated during migration"

2. **Pseudo-Code Format**: JSDoc vs inline comments vs sidecar files
   - âœ… Suggested default provided: JSDoc block comments
   - âœ… Rationale explained: "IDE integration"

3. **Business Logic Extraction Depth**: High-level vs detailed parsing
   - âœ… Suggested default provided: High-level flow + explicit validation rules
   - âœ… Rationale explained: "defer detailed logic parsing to Phase 2"

**All clarifications include:**

- âœ… Specific alternatives
- âœ… Trade-off analysis
- âœ… Recommended default
- âœ… Impact on feature implementation

## âœ… Independent User Stories

**Validation**: Each user story can be implemented and tested independently.

**Story 1 (P1)**: "Developer Creates First V2 Component from Extracted Baseline"

- âœ… **MVP Value**: Generates compilable V2 component with SDK scaffolding
- âœ… **Independent Test**: Run generation command, verify TypeScript compilation succeeds
- âœ… **Deliverable**: Working component file that compiles

**Story 2 (P2)**: "Component Integrates with Public API Proxy Pattern"

- âœ… **MVP Value**: Pseudo-code guides API integration without external docs
- âœ… **Independent Test**: Review pseudo-code for sequence 2 patterns (session, proxy, 429 handling)
- âœ… **Deliverable**: Pseudo-code with API integration guidance
- âœ… **Can implement without Story 1**: Yes, could manually create component and verify pseudo-code content

**Story 3 (P2)**: "Component Follows Configurator V2 Patterns"

- âœ… **MVP Value**: Generated code uses established Configurator conventions
- âœ… **Independent Test**: Inspect imports and structure, verify SDK/shadcn/React patterns
- âœ… **Deliverable**: Component with correct SDK integration
- âœ… **Can implement without Stories 1-2**: Yes, could verify conventions in isolation

**Story 4 (P3)**: "Business Logic Preserved from DAISY v1 Baseline"

- âœ… **MVP Value**: Pseudo-code captures specific GetAddressCard business rules
- âœ… **Independent Test**: Compare pseudo-code to baseline, verify validation/display logic captured
- âœ… **Deliverable**: Pseudo-code with GetAddressCard-specific logic
- âœ… **Can implement without Stories 1-3**: Yes, business logic analysis is separate concern

## âœ… Edge Case Coverage

**Validation**: Edge cases address boundary conditions and error scenarios.

- âœ… **Presentational components**: Handled (pseudo-code focuses on props/rendering)
- âœ… **Legacy patterns**: Handled ([MIGRATION_NOTE] comments for breaking changes)
- âœ… **Missing dependencies**: Handled (document dependencies, suggest migration order)
- âœ… **Complex state machines**: Handled (preserve state transition logic)
- âœ… **API error scenarios**: Handled (comprehensive error handling for 401, 429, 503)

## ðŸŽ¯ Overall Assessment

**SPECIFICATION READY**: âœ…

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation planning. All requirements are testable, success criteria are measurable, and clarification markers are within limits with suggested defaults.

**Recommended Next Steps**:

1. Present 3 clarification questions to user with suggested defaults
2. Wait for user confirmation or adjusted preferences
3. Proceed to implementation planning phase (speckit.implement.prompt.md)

**Key Strengths**:

- Clear priority ordering (P1-P3) enables incremental delivery
- Specific references to sequence 2 architecture ensure API integration accuracy
- Measurable success criteria enable objective validation
- Technology-agnostic requirements support flexible implementation

**No Critical Issues**: Specification meets all quality criteria for approval.
