## Checklist Coverage Analysis

### Total Items Addressed: 112 of 166 (67.5%)

#### By Category

| Category | Items Addressed | Total Items | Coverage |
|----------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Requirement Completeness | 33/33 | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Requirement Clarity | 28/28 | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Requirement Consistency | 11/11 | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Acceptance Criteria Quality | 13/13 | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Scenario Coverage | 8/17 | 47% | ⚠️ Partial |
| Edge Case Coverage | 3/13 | 23% | ⚠️ Partial |
| Non-Functional Requirements | 20/20 | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Dependencies & Assumptions | 11/11 | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Ambiguities & Conflicts | 12/12 | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Traceability | 8/8 | 100% | ✅ Complete |

### Remaining Gaps (54 items, 32.5%)

**Scenario Coverage Gaps** (9 items):

- CHK088-090: Alternate flows (batch mode, regeneration, variants)
- CHK091-098: Exception flows (missing baseline, corrupted code, disk space, permissions)

**Edge Case Coverage Gaps** (10 items):

- CHK103-108: Boundary conditions (zero deps, circular deps, large/small files, size limits, special chars)
- CHK109-115: Data quality edge cases (inconsistent style, mixed TS/JS, inline docs, generics, shared deps, migration order)

**Rationale for Deferral**:

- These gaps represent **Phase 2 enhancements** beyond GetAddressCard proof-of-concept scope
- Assumptions 5 and 6 explicitly scope this feature to GetAddressCard validation
- Feature Scope definition limits to single component proof-of-concept
- Template extensibility (Assumption 6) enables future coverage without blocking current feature

**Recommendation**: Address remaining gaps in follow-on features after GetAddressCard validation succeeds (per Assumption 5 migration order strategy).

2. **Template Design**: Create JSDoc pseudo-code templates implementing FR-019 to FR-022 formats
3. **AST Analyzer**: Implement baseline analyzer satisfying FR-015 to FR-018
4. **Error Handler**: Implement comprehensive error handling per FR-023 to FR-029

### Phase 2 Considerations (Post-GetAddressCard)

1. **Scenario Coverage**: Address CHK088-098 alternate/exception flows
2. **Edge Case Hardening**: Address CHK103-115 boundary/data quality scenarios
3. **Template Extensibility**: Validate Assumption 6 with second tier-1 component
4. **Batch Processing**: Implement NFR-002 batch mode for all 170 components

### Continuous Validation

1. **Traceability Audit**: Quarterly review of traceability matrix accuracy
2. **Assumption Validation**: Monthly validation of Assumptions 1-6 with latest baselines/SDK versions
3. **Gap Analysis**: Re-run checklist after each major feature addition
