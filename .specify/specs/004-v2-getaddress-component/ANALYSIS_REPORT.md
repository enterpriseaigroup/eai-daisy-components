## Findings

### Critical Issues (1)

#### C-001: Constitution Principle VI Violation - Incomplete Pseudo-Code Documentation Standards

**Severity**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** (Blocks implementation, violates NON-NEGOTIABLE principle)

**Location**:

- `spec.md` FR-004 (line ~85)
- `tasks.md` T028-T032 (pseudo-code formatting tasks)

**Description**:

Constitution Principle VI (Test Accuracy & Business Logic Validation) requires pseudo-code documentation to include 6 specific semantic fields:

```text
‚úÖ Required by Constitution:
1. WHY EXISTS (business justification)
2. WHAT DOES (functional behavior)
3. WHAT CALLS (API/function dependencies)
4. DATA FLOW (input ‚Üí transformation ‚Üí output)
5. DEPENDENCIES (external services, libraries)
6. SPECIAL BEHAVIOR (edge cases, error handling)
```

**Current State**:

- **FR-004**: "Generator MUST embed business pseudo-code as JSDoc block comments above function/component definitions, describing **business logic intent** in high-level natural language"
- **Tasks T028-T032**: Focus on format syntax (IF/THEN, FOR EACH, AWAIT/CATCH) but do NOT explicitly implement the 6 constitutional fields

**Impact**:

- Generated pseudo-code will be **incomplete** per constitutional standards
- Future business logic integration (Phase 2 of architecture migration) will lack necessary context
- Violates NON-NEGOTIABLE Principle VI added 2025-10-23

**Evidence**:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Current FR-004 approach (insufficient):
/**
 * BUSINESS LOGIC: Validates UK postcode format
 * IF postcode matches regex THEN accept ELSE reject
 */

// ‚úÖ Constitution-compliant approach (required):
/**
 * WHY EXISTS: UK address lookup requires valid postcode format per DPHI API contract
 * WHAT DOES: Validates postcode against UK government regex pattern (GDS standard)
 * WHAT CALLS: Uses regex /^[A-Z]{1,2}\d{1,2}[A-Z]?\s?\d[A-Z]{2}$/i from validation-utils.ts
 * DATA FLOW: postcode (string) ‚Üí regex validation ‚Üí boolean + error message
 * DEPENDENCIES: None (pure function using built-in RegExp)
 * SPECIAL BEHAVIOR: Handles optional space in middle (SW1A 1AA vs SW1A1AA)
 */
```

**Recommended Actions**:

1. **Update FR-004** to explicitly require 6-field documentation:

   ```markdown
   - **FR-004**: Generator MUST embed business pseudo-code as JSDoc block comments above 
     function/component definitions, including 6 required semantic fields per Constitution 
     Principle VI:
     1. WHY EXISTS (business justification)
     2. WHAT DOES (functional behavior description)
     3. WHAT CALLS (API/function/library dependencies)
     4. DATA FLOW (input types ‚Üí transformations ‚Üí output types)
     5. DEPENDENCIES (external services, libraries, configuration)
     6. SPECIAL BEHAVIOR (edge cases, error handling, performance considerations)
   ```

2. **Update Tasks T028-T032** to implement 6-field generation:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T028 [US2] Implement `src/pipeline/templates/pseudo-code-formatter.ts` with 
     `generate6FieldDocumentation()` function creating JSDoc blocks with WHY/WHAT/CALLS/
     DATAFLOW/DEPENDENCIES/BEHAVIOR sections per Constitution Principle VI
   
   - [ ] T029 [US2] Implement `formatConditionalLogic()` in formatter generating 
     `IF <condition> THEN <action> ELSE <alternative>` structure with 6-field 
     documentation per FR-004, FR-019
   ```

3. **Add Validation Task**:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T080 [P] Implement `validatePseudoCodeCompleteness()` in `src/pipeline/
     validators/pseudo-code-validator.ts` ensuring all 6 constitutional fields present 
     in generated JSDoc blocks, failing generation if any field missing per NFR-009
   ```

4. **Update Success Criteria SC-003**:

   ```markdown
   - **SC-003**: Generated component MUST include ‚â•15 business pseudo-code statements 
     AND all pseudo-code blocks MUST include 6 constitutional fields (WHY/WHAT/CALLS/
     DATAFLOW/DEPENDENCIES/BEHAVIOR)
   ```

**Effort Estimate**: 2-3 hours (update spec, modify templates, add validation)

---

### High Priority Issues (1)

#### H-001: Missing Automated Quality Gates - Accessibility & Visual Regression Testing

**Severity**: üü† **HIGH** (Constitutional requirement, blocks production release)

**Location**:

- `tasks.md` Phase 7 (missing tasks)
- `plan.md` Constitution Check Principle V

**Description**:

Constitution Principle V (Automated Quality Gates) requires:

- ‚úÖ Unit tests (implicit in T014-T056 component generation)
- ‚úÖ Integration tests (T073)
- ‚ùå **Accessibility tests** (NOT FOUND)
- ‚ùå **Visual regression tests** (NOT FOUND)

**Current State**:

- Tasks only include TypeScript compilation validation (T025) and integration test (T073)
- No accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance) for generated V2 components
- No visual regression testing to ensure visual parity with DAISY v1 baselines

**Impact**:

- Generated V2 components may have accessibility violations
- Visual regressions between V1 and V2 may go undetected
- Cannot confidently release to production without full quality gate coverage

**Recommended Actions**:

1. **Add Accessibility Testing Task**:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T076 [P] Implement accessibility testing in `tests/integration/v2-generation.test.ts` 
     using @axe-core/playwright to validate generated GetAddressCard meets WCAG 2.1 AA 
     standards (color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels) per Principle V
   ```

2. **Add Visual Regression Testing Task**:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T077 [P] Implement visual regression testing in `tests/visual/v2-visual-regression.test.ts` 
     using Playwright snapshots comparing generated GetAddressCard V2 against DAISY v1 
     baseline screenshots across 3 viewports (mobile 375px, tablet 768px, desktop 1920px) 
     per Principle V
   ```

3. **Update Integration Test Task T073**:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T073 Create integration test in `tests/integration/v2-generation.test.ts` running 
     full generation pipeline and validating output per SC-001 to SC-008, INCLUDING 
     accessibility audit (T076) and visual regression checks (T077)
   ```

**Effort Estimate**: 1-2 hours (add test tasks, configure Playwright + axe-core)

---

### Medium Priority Issues (2)

#### M-001: Missing Semantic Version Bump Task

**Severity**: üü° **MEDIUM** (Required by NON-NEGOTIABLE Principle III)

**Location**: `tasks.md` Phase 7

**Description**:

Constitution Principle III (Semantic Versioning) is **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. Plan.md confirms this feature requires a MINOR version bump (new V2 generation capability, no breaking changes). However, no task explicitly updates `package.json` version numbers.

**Recommended Action**:

```markdown
- [ ] T078 Update semantic versions in all package.json files (root, packages/v2-components/) 
  per Principle III: MINOR bump for new V2 generation capability (e.g., 2.1.0 ‚Üí 2.2.0), 
  update CHANGELOG.md with feature summary, breaking changes section (none)
```

**Effort Estimate**: 15 minutes

---

#### M-002: Terminology Inconsistency - "Visual-Only" vs "Business Logic Preservation"

**Severity**: üü° **MEDIUM** (Semantic confusion, not blocking)

**Location**:

- `spec.md` Definitions section
- `plan.md` Summary
- Constitution Principle II

**Description**:

Semantic tension between terminology:

- **Constitution Principle II**: "V2 = visual-only initially"
- **Spec FR-003**: "describe Public API integration pattern" (documentation)
- **User Story 2**: "Component integrates with Public API" (sounds like implementation)

**Clarification Needed**:

Are we generating:

1. **Visual-only components** with pseudo-code documentation (matches constitution), OR
2. **Functional components** with actual API integration (contradicts constitution)?

**Current Interpretation** (from plan.md):

- V2 components = **visual-only React code**
- Business logic = **pseudo-code comments only** (for future Phase 2 integration)
- "Integration" = **documentation pattern**, not implementation

**Recommended Action**:

Add clarifying definition to `spec.md` Definitions section:

```markdown
### Visual-Only V2 Component

A React component generated for Configurator SDK v2.1.0+ that implements ONLY visual/UI 
logic (JSX structure, styling, user interactions). Business logic (API calls, validation, 
data transformations) is preserved as pseudo-code documentation in JSDoc comments above 
function definitions, describing WHAT the business logic DOES without implementing it. 
This enables incremental migration: Phase 1 = generate visual-only V2, Phase 2 = 
integrate business logic from pseudo-code. Aligns with Constitution Principle II 
(Architecture Migration Protocol).
```

**Effort Estimate**: 5 minutes (add definition)

---

### Low Priority Issues (2)

#### L-001: Missing Package Dependency Validation

**Severity**: üü¢ **LOW** (Quality improvement, not blocking)

**Location**: `tasks.md` T002

**Description**:

Task T002 creates `packages/v2-components/package.json` but doesn't validate peer dependencies match specification requirements (Configurator SDK v2.1.0+, shadcn/ui v0.4.0+, React 18+).

**Recommended Action**:

```markdown
- [ ] T079 [P] Implement `validatePackageDependencies()` in `src/utils/package-validator.ts` 
  ensuring generated package.json includes correct versions: @elevenlabs-ui/configurator-sdk 
  ^2.1.0, shadcn/ui ^0.4.0, react ^18.0.0, react-dom ^18.0.0 per spec Technical Context
```

**Effort Estimate**: 15 minutes

---

#### L-002: Missing Test Fixture Validation

**Severity**: üü¢ **LOW** (Quality improvement, not blocking)

**Location**: `tasks.md` T047

**Description**:

Constitution Principle VI requires test fixtures to be TypeScript-parseable (no CSS imports breaking AST analysis). Task T047 creates test scaffold but doesn't validate fixture format compliance.

**Recommended Action**:

Update T047:

```markdown
- [ ] T047 [US3] Implement `generateTestScaffold()` in `src/pipeline/generators/v2-generator.ts` 
  creating `__tests__/GetAddressCard.test.tsx` with basic test structure per FR-012, 
  validating test fixtures are TypeScript-parseable (no CSS imports) per Principle VI
```

**Effort Estimate**: 10 minutes

---

## Constitution Compliance Analysis

| Principle | Status | Evidence | Issues |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| **I. Component Independence** | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Plan.md confirms self-contained NPM package, T001-T005 create packages/v2-components/ isolation | None |
| **II. Architecture Migration Protocol** | ‚úÖ **PASS** | FR-007 preserves /daisyv1/ baselines, V2 generation in packages/v2-components/, visual-first with pseudo-code | M-002: Terminology clarity needed |
| **III. Semantic Versioning** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NON-NEGOTIABLE** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** | Plan confirms MINOR version bump required | M-001: No task updates package.json versions |

## Consistency Analysis

### Terminology Usage

| Term | Usage Across Artifacts | Consistency | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
| **"Business Logic"** | spec.md (33 times), plan.md (12 times), tasks.md (8 times) | ‚úÖ Consistent | Refers to validation, transformation, conditional rendering logic from DAISY v1 |
| **"Pseudo-Code"** | spec.md (28 times), plan.md (6 times), tasks.md (15 times) | ‚úÖ Consistent | JSDoc block comments describing business logic intent |
| **"Baseline Component"** | spec.md (14 times), plan.md (9 times), tasks.md (5 times) | ‚úÖ Consistent | Original DAISY v1 component in /daisyv1/ directory |
| **"V2 Component"** | spec.md (41 times), plan.md (18 times), tasks.md (23 times) | ‚úÖ Consistent | Newly generated Configurator SDK v2 component |
| **"Visual-Only"** | constitution.md (3 times), plan.md (2 times), spec.md (0 times) | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Inconsistent** | Term missing from spec.md Definitions section (see M-002) |
| **"GetAddressCard"** | spec.md (12 times), tasks.md (8 times) | ‚úÖ Consistent | V2 component name |
| **"useRenderAddressCard"** | plan.md (3 times), spec.md (1 time) | ‚úÖ Consistent | V1 baseline hook name |

**Terminology Drift**: 1 instance (M-002: "visual-only" concept not defined in spec)

---

## Duplication Analysis

**No near-duplicate requirements detected** ‚úÖ

All 47 requirements (33 FRs + 14 NFRs) have distinct purposes:

- FR-001 to FR-033: Progressive feature decomposition (component generation ‚Üí AST analysis ‚Üí pseudo-code ‚Üí API patterns ‚Üí recovery)
- NFR-001 to NFR-014: Distinct quality attributes (performance, observability, reliability, security)

**No overlapping tasks detected** ‚úÖ

All 75 tasks have clear boundaries:

- T001-T005: Independent setup tasks (directory, package.json, tsconfig, README, root tsconfig)
- T008-T010: Distinct logging components (schema, JSON logger, console progress)
- T028-T032: Different pseudo-code formats (conditional, loop, async, state transition)

---

## Ambiguity Analysis

| Item | Ambiguous Term | Current Definition | Recommended Improvement |
|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| FR-004 | "business logic intent" | Vague, doesn't specify 6 constitutional fields | Replace with "6-field documentation per Principle VI: WHY/WHAT/CALLS/DATAFLOW/DEPENDENCIES/BEHAVIOR" (see C-001) |
| FR-005 | "business logic patterns" | No explicit list of pattern categories | Add examples: "validation rules, data transformations, conditional rendering, state machines" |
| SC-003 | "business pseudo-code" | Not tied to constitutional requirements | Update to "pseudo-code blocks with 6 constitutional fields" |

**Ambiguity Score**: üü¢ **LOW** (3 instances out of 47 requirements = 6.4%)

Most requirements use measurable terms:

- NFR-001: "under 30 seconds on standard hardware (16GB RAM, 4-core CPU, SSD)"
- NFR-003: "under 2GB during AST analysis of large baseline files (>5000 LOC)"
- NFR-006: "naming convention: `v2-generation-{timestamp}.jsonl`"

---

## Gap Analysis

### Orphaned Tasks

**No orphaned tasks detected** ‚úÖ

All 75 tasks explicitly reference FRs, NFRs, User Stories, or Success Criteria in their descriptions.

### Recommended Additional Tasks

Based on constitutional requirements and quality improvements:

1. **T076**: Accessibility testing (addresses H-001)
2. **T077**: Visual regression testing (addresses H-001)
3. **T078**: Semantic version bump (addresses M-001)
4. **T079**: Package dependency validation (addresses L-001)
5. **T080**: Pseudo-code completeness validation (addresses C-001)

**Task Completeness**: **93%** (75/80 tasks defined)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Readiness

**Current State**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Blockers**:

1. **CRITICAL**: Pseudo-code documentation violates Constitution Principle VI (C-001)
2. **HIGH**: Missing automated quality gates (accessibility, visual regression) (H-001)

**After Addressing CRITICAL + HIGH**:

- ‚úÖ **READY FOR MVP** (Phases 1-3: Setup + Foundational + US1-P1)
- ‚è≥ **READY FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION** after addressing MEDIUM + LOW issues

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|------------|
| Pseudo-code incompleteness | **HIGH** (currently present) | **CRITICAL** (blocks Phase 2 business logic integration) | üî¥ **CRITICAL** | Address C-001 immediately |
| Missing accessibility tests | **MEDIUM** (can be added later) | **HIGH** (blocks production release) | üü† **HIGH** | Address H-001 before production |
| Version bump omitted | **LOW** (easy to forget) | **MEDIUM** (violates NON-NEGOTIABLE principle) | üü° **MEDIUM** | Add T078 to Phase 7 |
| Terminology confusion | **LOW** (documented in plan) | **LOW** (semantic only) | üü¢ **LOW** | Add definition per M-002 |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Implementation)

#### 1. Address C-001: Update Pseudo-Code Documentation Requirements (CRITICAL)

**Effort**: 2-3 hours | **Priority**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** | **Blocking**: Yes

**Changes Required**:

1. Update `spec.md` FR-004:

   ```markdown
   - **FR-004**: Generator MUST embed business pseudo-code as JSDoc block comments above 
     function/component definitions, including 6 required semantic fields per Constitution 
     Principle VI:
     1. WHY EXISTS (business justification and origin)
     2. WHAT DOES (functional behavior and outcomes)
     3. WHAT CALLS (API endpoints, functions, library dependencies)
     4. DATA FLOW (input types ‚Üí transformations ‚Üí output types)
     5. DEPENDENCIES (external services, libraries, configuration requirements)
     6. SPECIAL BEHAVIOR (edge cases, error handling, performance considerations)
     
     Example: UK postcode validation function includes WHY (DPHI API contract requirement), 
     WHAT (validates format), CALLS (regex from validation-utils.ts), DATAFLOW (string ‚Üí 
     boolean + error), DEPENDENCIES (none), BEHAVIOR (handles optional space in middle).
   ```

2. Add new requirement `spec.md`:

   ```markdown
   - **FR-034**: Generator MUST validate pseudo-code completeness, ensuring all 6 
     constitutional fields (WHY/WHAT/CALLS/DATAFLOW/DEPENDENCIES/BEHAVIOR) are present 
     in generated JSDoc blocks. If any field is missing or empty, generation MUST fail 
     with exit code 3 (business-logic-incomplete) per API contract.
   ```

3. Update `tasks.md` T028:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T028 [US2] Implement `src/pipeline/templates/pseudo-code-formatter.ts` with 
     `generate6FieldDocumentation()` function creating JSDoc blocks with WHY EXISTS, 
     WHAT DOES, WHAT CALLS, DATA FLOW, DEPENDENCIES, SPECIAL BEHAVIOR sections per 
     Constitution Principle VI and FR-004
   ```

4. Add new task `tasks.md`:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T080 [P] Implement `validatePseudoCodeCompleteness()` in `src/pipeline/validators/
     pseudo-code-validator.ts` ensuring all 6 constitutional fields present in generated 
     JSDoc blocks, failing generation with exit code 3 if any field missing per FR-034, 
     NFR-009 (idempotent validation)
   ```

5. Update `tasks.md` Success Criteria SC-003:

   ```markdown
   - **SC-003**: Generated component MUST include ‚â•15 business pseudo-code statements 
     AND all pseudo-code blocks MUST include 6 constitutional fields (WHY EXISTS, WHAT 
     DOES, WHAT CALLS, DATA FLOW, DEPENDENCIES, SPECIAL BEHAVIOR) per Principle VI
   ```

**Validation**:

- [ ] Run `/speckit.checklist` to confirm FR-034 addresses CHK015-022 (pseudo-code representation)
- [ ] Verify SC-003 update makes acceptance criteria testable
- [ ] Confirm T080 task references NFR-009 (idempotent validation)

#### 2. Address H-001: Add Missing Quality Gates (HIGH)

**Effort**: 1-2 hours | **Priority**: üü† **HIGH** | **Blocking**: No (MVP can proceed)

**Changes Required**:

1. Add accessibility testing task to `tasks.md` Phase 7:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T076 [P] Implement accessibility testing in `tests/integration/v2-generation.test.ts` 
     using @axe-core/playwright to validate generated GetAddressCard meets WCAG 2.1 AA 
     standards: color contrast ratios ‚â•4.5:1, keyboard navigation support (Tab, Enter, 
     Escape), ARIA labels on interactive elements, semantic HTML structure per Constitution 
     Principle V
   ```

2. Add visual regression testing task to `tasks.md` Phase 7:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T077 [P] Implement visual regression testing in `tests/visual/v2-visual-regression.
     test.ts` using Playwright visual snapshots comparing generated GetAddressCard V2 
     against DAISY v1 baseline screenshots across 3 viewports (mobile 375px, tablet 768px, 
     desktop 1920px), threshold 0.2% diff tolerance per Constitution Principle V
   ```

3. Update `tasks.md` T073 to reference new tests:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] T073 Create integration test in `tests/integration/v2-generation.test.ts` running 
     full generation pipeline and validating output per SC-001 to SC-008, INCLUDING 
     accessibility audit (T076) and visual regression checks (T077)
   ```

4. Add dependencies to `package.json`:

   ```json
   "devDependencies": {
     "@axe-core/playwright": "^4.8.0",
     "@playwright/test": "^1.40.0"
   }
   ```

**Validation**:

- [ ] Confirm accessibility tests cover keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Verify visual regression tests include 3 viewports per spec
- [ ] Run `npm install` to install new dependencies

### Recommended Actions (Before Full Implementation)

#### 3. Address M-001: Add Semantic Version Bump Task (MEDIUM)

**Effort**: 15 minutes | **Priority**: üü° **MEDIUM**

Add to `tasks.md` Phase 7:

```markdown
- [ ] T078 Update semantic versions in all package.json files (root, packages/v2-components/) 
  per Constitution Principle III (NON-NEGOTIABLE): MINOR bump for new V2 generation 
  capability (e.g., 2.1.0 ‚Üí 2.2.0), update CHANGELOG.md with feature summary, verify 
  breaking changes section empty (none expected)
```

---

#### 4. Address M-002: Clarify "Visual-Only" Terminology (MEDIUM)

**Effort**: 5 minutes | **Priority**: üü° **MEDIUM**

Add to `spec.md` Definitions section (after "Pseudo-Code"):

```markdown
### Visual-Only V2 Component

A React component generated for Configurator SDK v2.1.0+ that implements ONLY visual/UI 
logic: JSX structure, styling (via shadcn/ui), user interactions (onClick, onChange). 
Business logic (API calls, validation rules, data transformations) is preserved as 
pseudo-code documentation in JSDoc comments above function definitions, describing WHAT 
the business logic DOES without implementing it. This enables incremental migration:

- **Phase 1** (this feature): Generate visual-only V2 components with pseudo-code documentation
- **Phase 2** (future): Integrate business logic from pseudo-code into functional implementations

Aligns with Constitution Principle II (Architecture Migration Protocol): preserve DAISY v1 
baselines in /daisyv1/, create visual-first V2 in packages/v2-components/, document business 
logic for later integration.

**Example**: GetAddressCard V2 component renders form fields, buttons, and loading states 
using shadcn/ui components. API integration logic (fetch postcode lookup, handle rate limiting, 
parse response) exists ONLY as pseudo-code comments, NOT as executable TypeScript code.
```

---

### Optional Improvements (Low Priority)

#### 5. Address L-001: Add Package Dependency Validation (LOW)

**Effort**: 15 minutes

Add to `tasks.md` Phase 7:

```markdown
- [ ] T079 [P] Implement `validatePackageDependencies()` in `src/utils/package-validator.ts` 
  ensuring generated package.json includes correct versions: @elevenlabs-ui/configurator-sdk 
  ^2.1.0, @/components/ui (shadcn/ui) ^0.4.0, react ^18.0.0, react-dom ^18.0.0 per spec 
  Technical Context, failing generation with exit code 2 (compilation-error) if mismatch
```

---

#### 6. Address L-002: Update Test Fixture Validation (LOW)

**Effort**: 10 minutes

Update `tasks.md` T047:

```markdown
- [ ] T047 [US3] Implement `generateTestScaffold()` in `src/pipeline/generators/v2-generator.ts` 
  creating `__tests__/GetAddressCard.test.tsx` with basic test structure per FR-012, 
  validating test fixtures are TypeScript-parseable (no CSS imports, no dynamic requires) 
  per Constitution Principle VI
```

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0: Remediation (Recommended Before Implementation)

**Duration**: 3-5 hours | **Status**: ‚è≥ **Pending user approval**

1. **CRITICAL**: Address C-001 (pseudo-code documentation) - 2-3 hours
2. **HIGH**: Address H-001 (quality gates) - 1-2 hours
3. **MEDIUM**: Address M-001 (version bump task) - 15 minutes
4. **MEDIUM**: Address M-002 (terminology clarification) - 5 minutes
5. **Optional**: Address L-001, L-002 - 25 minutes

**Exit Criteria**:

- [ ] All CRITICAL issues resolved
- [ ] All HIGH issues resolved (or explicitly deferred with justification)
- [ ] Spec updated with FR-034 and 6-field pseudo-code documentation
- [ ] Tasks updated with T076-T078 (accessibility, visual regression, version bump)
- [ ] Constitution Principle VI compliance validated

---

### Phase 1: MVP Implementation (After Remediation)

**Scope**: Phases 1-3 from tasks.md (T001-T026)

**Duration**: ~28 hours

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Working GetAddressCard V2 generation pipeline
- [ ] Generated component compiles with zero TypeScript errors (SC-002)
- [ ] Pseudo-code includes 6 constitutional fields (updated SC-003)
- [ ] Integration test passes (T073 + T076 + T077)

**Success Criteria**:

- All 8 success criteria (SC-001 to SC-008) pass
- Constitutional compliance: 100% (6/6 principles)
- Zero CRITICAL or HIGH issues remaining
