# Implementation Tasks: Component Architecture Migration Pipeline

**Feature**: Component Architecture Migration Pipeline  
**Branch**: `001-component-extraction-pipeline`  
**Generated**: 2025-10-22  
**Related**: [Implementation Plan](./plan.md) | [Feature Spec](./spec.md)

## Overview

This document breaks down the component migration pipeline implementation into executable tasks organized by user story. Each phase delivers an independently testable increment.

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (P1) - Basic component migration pipeline  
**Incremental Delivery**: Each user story phase represents a complete, deployable increment  
**Parallel Opportunities**: Tasks marked with [P] can be executed in parallel within phases

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 47
- **Setup Phase**: 8 tasks (project initialization)
- **Foundational Phase**: 7 tasks (blocking prerequisites)
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 15 tasks (core migration pipeline)
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: 9 tasks (external developer experience)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: 5 tasks (comprehensive migration management)
- **Polish Phase**: 3 tasks (cross-cutting concerns)

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order**:
1. Setup → Foundational (blocking)
2. Foundational → User Story 1 (blocking)
3. User Story 1 → User Story 2 (dependency: migrated components needed for consumption)
4. User Story 2 → User Story 3 (dependency: proven component consumption before full migration)
5. User Story 3 → Polish (final optimizations)

**Parallel Execution**: Within each story phase, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
