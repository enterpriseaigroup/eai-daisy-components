# Feature Specification: Component Architecture Migration Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `001-component-extraction-pipeline`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This repo serves as the public distribution channel for design system components migrated from DAISY v1 to Configurator (DAISY v2) architecture. Components maintain business logic while transforming to work with modern Configurator patterns, shadcn/ui foundation, and elevenlabs integration."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Component Developer Migrates DAISY v1 Components (Priority: P1)

A component developer needs to copy DAISY v1 components with full business logic into `/daisyv1/` directory as baseline, then create new Configurator-compatible versions that transform the business logic to work with DAISY v2 architecture while maintaining functional equivalency.

**Why this priority**: This establishes the foundation for all component migrations - without the baseline and transformation process, no components can be successfully migrated to the new architecture.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a single DAISY v1 component, copying it to `/daisyv1/`, transforming its business logic for Configurator architecture, and verifying functional equivalency between versions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a component exists in DAISY v1 repository, **When** developer runs migration pipeline, **Then** component is copied to `/daisyv1/` with complete business logic preserved
2. **Given** a DAISY v1 baseline component, **When** transformation process runs, **Then** new component is created with business logic adapted for Configurator patterns
3. **Given** a transformed component, **When** tested against baseline, **Then** functional equivalency is maintained while architecture compliance is achieved

### User Story 2 - External Developer Consumes Migrated Components (Priority: P2)

An external developer wants to discover, install, and use components from the EAI Daisy component library that contain full business logic adapted for Configurator architecture, with complete TypeScript support and clear documentation showing both DAISY v1 baseline and new implementation.

**Why this priority**: Component adoption depends on developer experience and confidence that business logic has been properly preserved during migration. Documentation showing transformation rationale builds trust.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new React project, installing a migrated component, and successfully implementing it using Configurator patterns while comparing against DAISY v1 baseline behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a migrated component, **When** developer searches npm, **Then** component appears with clear description, business logic documentation, and migration notes
2. **Given** component documentation, **When** developer follows setup instructions, **Then** component renders correctly with Configurator architecture integration
3. **Given** TypeScript project, **When** developer imports component, **Then** full type safety and IntelliSense support is available with Configurator-compatible interfaces

---

### User Story 3 - Design System Team Maintains Migration Sync (Priority: P3)

The design system team needs to keep the component migration pipeline synchronized with updates from both DAISY v1 baseline and Configurator platform changes while maintaining business logic equivalency and tracking architectural transformation decisions.

**Why this priority**: Long-term sustainability requires automated synchronization between baseline and migrated versions. Manual processes don't scale and lead to drift between architectures.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by updating business logic in a DAISY v1 component, triggering the migration sync process, and verifying the Configurator-compatible version receives appropriate updates with preserved functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** business logic update in DAISY v1 component, **When** sync process runs, **Then** baseline in `/daisyv1/` is updated and migration assessment is triggered
2. **Given** breaking change in Configurator platform, **When** migration analysis runs, **Then** affected components are identified and transformation plan is generated
3. **Given** new business logic pattern in DAISY v1, **When** marked for migration, **Then** component appears in migration queue with architecture transformation analysis

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when DAISY v1 business logic conflicts with Configurator architectural patterns?
- How does the system handle components that use DAISY v1-specific APIs or services?
- What happens when DAISY v1 and Configurator have different business logic implementations for the same feature?
- How are components handled that require DAISY v1 authentication patterns but need to work with Configurator?
- What happens when migrated components have dependencies on other unmigrated DAISY v1 components?
- How does the system handle business logic that spans multiple DAISY v1 components but needs to be consolidated in Configurator?

### Key Entities

- **DAISY v1 Component**: Original component with complete business logic, stored in `/daisyv1/` directory as baseline reference

## Assumptions

- DAISY v1 and Configurator repositories use compatible React component patterns that allow business logic transformation
- Components contain clearly separable business logic that can be adapted between architectural patterns
- shadcn/ui and elevenlabs provide sufficient foundation for implementing Configurator-compatible component patterns
- Target applications will use modern React (16.8+) with hooks support and Configurator integration capabilities
- npm registry will be the primary distribution channel for both baseline and migrated components
- External consumers will primarily use TypeScript or JavaScript with modern build tools and Configurator platform integration
- Business logic transformation can be systematically analyzed and adapted through architectural pattern mapping
- DAISY v1 components contain well-structured business logic that can be preserved during architecture migration
- Configurator platform provides sufficient APIs and patterns to support all existing DAISY v1 business logic use cases
