# Feature Specification: Component Architecture Migration Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `001-component-extraction-pipeline`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This repo serves as the public distribution channel for design system components migrated from DAISY v1 to Configurator (DAISY v2) architecture. Components maintain business logic while transforming to work with modern Configurator patterns, shadcn/ui foundation, and elevenlabs integration."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: How should migration pipeline performance be scoped across component complexity levels? → A: All complexity levels (30 min), serial processing
- Q: What scope should functional equivalency validation cover? → A: Exhaustive testing including all possible interactions
- Q: How should business logic conflicts between DAISY v1 and Configurator be resolved? → A: DAISY v1 logic preserved exactly, Configurator adapts
- Q: How should component dependency migration order be handled? → A: Dependency-first migration with temporary stubs
- Q: What triggers migration synchronization between DAISY v1 and migrated versions? → A: One-time migration only

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Component Developer Migrates DAISY v1 Components (Priority: P1)

A component developer needs to copy DAISY v1 components with full business logic into `/daisyv1/` directory as baseline, then create new Configurator-compatible versions that transform the business logic to work with DAISY v2 architecture while maintaining functional equivalency.

**Why this priority**: This establishes the foundation for all component migrations - without the baseline and transformation process, no components can be successfully migrated to the new architecture.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a single DAISY v1 component, copying it to `/daisyv1/`, transforming its business logic for Configurator architecture, and verifying functional equivalency between versions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a component exists in DAISY v1 repository, **When** developer runs migration pipeline, **Then** component is copied to `/daisyv1/` with complete business logic preserved
2. **Given** a DAISY v1 baseline component, **When** transformation process runs, **Then** new component is created with business logic adapted for Configurator patterns
3. **Given** a transformed component, **When** tested against baseline, **Then** functional equivalency is maintained while architecture compliance is achieved

### User Story 2 - External Developer Consumes Migrated Components (Priority: P2)

An external developer wants to discover, install, and use components from the EAI Daisy component library that contain full business logic adapted for Configurator architecture, with complete TypeScript support and clear documentation showing both DAISY v1 baseline and new implementation.

**Why this priority**: Component adoption depends on developer experience and confidence that business logic has been properly preserved during migration. Documentation showing transformation rationale builds trust.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new React project, installing a migrated component, and successfully implementing it using Configurator patterns while comparing against DAISY v1 baseline behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a migrated component, **When** developer searches npm, **Then** component appears with clear description, business logic documentation, and migration notes
2. **Given** component documentation, **When** developer follows setup instructions, **Then** component renders correctly with Configurator architecture integration
3. **Given** TypeScript project, **When** developer imports component, **Then** full type safety and IntelliSense support is available with Configurator-compatible interfaces

### User Story 3 - Design System Team Manages One-Time Migration (Priority: P3)

The design system team needs to execute a comprehensive one-time migration of all DAISY v1 components to Configurator-compatible versions, maintaining business logic equivalency and tracking architectural transformation decisions without ongoing synchronization requirements.

**Why this priority**: Since no further DAISY v1 changes are expected, the focus shifts from ongoing sync to thorough one-time migration with comprehensive validation and documentation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing the full migration of all DAISY v1 components, validating functional equivalency, and confirming no synchronization mechanism is needed for future updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** complete DAISY v1 component inventory, **When** one-time migration process runs, **Then** all components are migrated with business logic preservation and no sync mechanism established
2. **Given** migrated component library, **When** validation process completes, **Then** all components pass equivalency tests and migration is marked as final
3. **Given** completed migration, **When** DAISY v1 changes occur (edge case), **Then** system logs but does not automatically sync, requiring manual intervention if needed

---

### Edge Cases

- When DAISY v1 business logic conflicts with Configurator architectural patterns, DAISY v1 logic is preserved exactly and Configurator architecture adapts to accommodate the original business logic behavior
- When components use DAISY v1-specific APIs or services, the system copies the entire component and its business logic. If API calls cause errors, the system stubs the API calls so errors do not impact the Storybook display of the element
- When DAISY v1 and Configurator have different business logic implementations for the same feature, the system performs a complete copy of DAISY v1 business logic without modification. Configurator alignment will be addressed in future feature branches
- When components require DAISY v1 authentication patterns, the system copies the authentication logic as-is. Authentication integration with Configurator will be resolved in later feature branches
- When migrated components have dependencies on other unmigrated DAISY v1 components, the system uses dependency-first migration order with temporary stubs to allow parallel development
- When business logic spans multiple DAISY v1 components, the system highlights the cross-component business logic in both components' documentation to aid future consolidation planning

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST copy UI components from DAISY v1 repository to `/daisyv1/` directory while preserving complete business logic and functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST transform DAISY v1 business logic to work with Configurator architecture patterns while maintaining functional equivalency, with Configurator architecture adapting to preserve exact DAISY v1 business logic behavior when conflicts arise, and MUST validate business logic preservation by testing against DAISY v1 baseline functionality in isolated environments
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate TypeScript definitions for all migrated components with interfaces compatible with Configurator integration patterns
- **FR-004**: System MUST create comprehensive documentation including business logic transformation notes, API reference, usage examples, and migration rationale for each component

- Components contain clearly separable business logic that can be adapted between architectural patterns
- shadcn/ui and elevenlabs provide sufficient foundation for implementing Configurator-compatible component patterns
- Target applications will use modern React (16.8+) with hooks support and Configurator integration capabilities
- npm registry will be the primary distribution channel for both baseline and migrated components
- External consumers will primarily use TypeScript or JavaScript with modern build tools and Configurator platform integration
- Business logic transformation can be systematically analyzed and adapted through architectural pattern mapping
- DAISY v1 components contain well-structured business logic that can be preserved during one-time architecture migration
- Configurator platform provides sufficient APIs and patterns to support all existing DAISY v1 business logic use cases
- No ongoing DAISY v1 updates are expected, making one-time migration approach viable and cost-effective
