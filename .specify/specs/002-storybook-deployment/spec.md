# Feature Specification: Public Storybook Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `002-storybook-deployment`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a storybook for this repo that we will deploy on github publically to showcase the migrated components from DAISY v1 and the new Configurator-compatible components with their business logic transformations."

**Architecture Note**: This repository provides complete DAISY v1 component copies (visual + usage + business logic) in `/daisyv1/` directory and visual-only V2 components based on shadcn/elevenlabs baseline, packaged as NPM components. Business logic integration with Configurator public APIs is added in later development phases.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: How many components do you expect the Storybook system to handle initially and at full scale? → A: Medium scale (50-200 components)
- Q: How should components requiring Configurator context or authentication be handled in the isolated Storybook environment? → A: Live integration - connect to actual Configurator/auth systems
- Q: What uptime and availability expectations do you have for the public Storybook documentation site? → A: Basic availability (99% uptime) - Occasional outages acceptable
- Q: What level of traffic and user access do you expect for the public Storybook site? → A: Light traffic (10-100 daily users) - Internal team and select partners
- Q: How should breaking changes to components be handled in the public documentation as the library evolves? → A: Multiple versions simultaneously

**Clarification Update**: Edge cases involving business logic integration are deferred to later development phases when Configurator public API connections are added to visual-only V2 components.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - External Developer Explores Component Library (Priority: P1)

An external developer wants to discover and evaluate visual components from the EAI Daisy library by browsing an interactive documentation site that shows complete DAISY v1 components and visual-only V2 components based on shadcn/elevenlabs foundation, packaged as NPM components for easy integration.

**Why this priority**: Visual component discovery and evaluation is the primary driver for adoption. Developers need to see component visual design and NPM integration patterns before considering business logic integration in later phases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the public Storybook URL, browsing component categories, and successfully viewing interactive visual examples of both complete DAISY v1 components and visual-only V2 NPM components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a deployed Storybook site, **When** external developer visits the URL, **Then** they see a categorized component library with complete DAISY v1 components and visual-only V2 NPM components
2. **Given** a V2 component in Storybook, **When** developer selects it, **Then** they see interactive visual examples, NPM installation instructions, and shadcn/elevenlabs foundation documentation
3. **Given** component documentation, **When** developer reviews integration details, **Then** they understand how to install and use visual-only V2 components as NPM packages

---

### User Story 2 - Design System Team Showcases Components (Priority: P2)

The design system team needs to demonstrate visual component consistency to stakeholders by showing side-by-side comparisons of complete DAISY v1 components and visual-only V2 components based on shadcn/elevenlabs foundation, with clear NPM packaging and visual design preservation documentation.

**Why this priority**: Stakeholder communication requires visual demonstration that design consistency is maintained while components become NPM-packaged visual components. Storybook provides a professional showcase for visual component development efforts.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the Storybook, navigating to visual comparison views, and successfully demonstrating visual consistency between complete DAISY v1 components and visual-only V2 NPM components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** V2 visual components in Storybook, **When** team presents to stakeholders, **Then** they can demonstrate visual consistency between complete DAISY v1 components and visual-only V2 NPM components
2. **Given** NPM packaging documentation, **When** stakeholders review changes, **Then** they understand how visual components are distributed and integrated while preserving visual design
3. **Given** component examples, **When** team shows shadcn/elevenlabs foundation patterns, **Then** stakeholders see how visual components maintain design consistency

---

### User Story 3 - Component Developer Documents Visual Development Process (Priority: P3)

A component developer needs to document the visual component development process by creating Storybook stories that show complete DAISY v1 components, their visual-only V2 implementations based on shadcn/elevenlabs foundation, and provide NPM packaging guidance for other developers to follow.

**Why this priority**: Documentation of the visual development process helps scale the effort and provides templates for future V2 component development. It builds institutional knowledge about shadcn/elevenlabs foundation patterns while business logic integration is handled in later development phases.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new V2 visual component story, documenting the development process, and verifying that other developers can understand how to create visual-only components based on DAISY v1 reference.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a V2 visual component, **When** developer creates Storybook documentation, **Then** the story includes DAISY v1 comparison, shadcn/elevenlabs foundation usage, and NPM packaging guidance
2. **Given** visual development documentation, **When** other developers review it, **Then** they can understand the visual component patterns and apply them to other components
3. **Given** NPM component examples, **When** developers implement them, **Then** they successfully create visual-only V2 components based on shadcn/elevenlabs foundation

### Edge Cases

**Note**: Business logic integration edge cases are deferred to later development phases when Configurator public API connections are added to visual-only V2 components.

- What happens when DAISY v1 components have visual dependencies that can't be replicated using shadcn/elevenlabs foundation?
- How does the system handle NPM packaging when V2 visual components have conflicting dependencies with shadcn/elevenlabs?
- What happens when visual component props interfaces differ between DAISY v1 complete components and V2 visual-only implementations?
- How are components documented when their V2 visual implementation is incomplete or differs from DAISY v1 visual design?
- What happens when NPM component examples require specific styling frameworks that conflict with shadcn/elevenlabs foundation?
- How does the Storybook handle responsive design testing for V2 visual components that will later have business logic added?
- How does the system manage version alignment between V2 visual components and their future business logic integration phases?
