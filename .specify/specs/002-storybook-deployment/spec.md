# Feature Specification: Public Storybook Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `002-storybook-deployment`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a storybook for this repo that we will deploy on github publically to showcase the migrated components from DAISY v1 and the new Configurator-compatible components with their business logic transformations."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - External Developer Explores Component Library (Priority: P1)

An external developer wants to discover and evaluate components from the EAI Daisy library by browsing an interactive documentation site that shows both DAISY v1 baseline components and their Configurator-compatible migrated versions with live examples and business logic transformation explanations.

**Why this priority**: Component discovery and evaluation is the primary driver for adoption. Without accessible documentation, developers won't know what components exist or how to use them effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the public Storybook URL, browsing component categories, and successfully viewing interactive examples of both baseline and migrated components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a deployed Storybook site, **When** external developer visits the URL, **Then** they see a categorized component library with DAISY v1 and Configurator sections
2. **Given** a component in Storybook, **When** developer selects it, **Then** they see interactive examples, props documentation, and business logic transformation notes
3. **Given** component documentation, **When** developer reviews migration details, **Then** they understand the differences between DAISY v1 baseline and Configurator-compatible versions

---

### User Story 2 - Design System Team Showcases Components (Priority: P2)

The design system team needs to demonstrate component migration progress to stakeholders by showing side-by-side comparisons of DAISY v1 baseline components and their Configurator-compatible versions with clear business logic transformation documentation.

**Why this priority**: Stakeholder communication and progress tracking require visual demonstration of migration work. Storybook provides a professional showcase for component transformation efforts.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the Storybook, navigating to migration comparison views, and successfully demonstrating functional equivalency between component versions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** migrated components in Storybook, **When** team presents to stakeholders, **Then** they can demonstrate functional equivalency between DAISY v1 and Configurator versions
2. **Given** business logic transformation documentation, **When** stakeholders review changes, **Then** they understand architectural improvements and preserved functionality
3. **Given** component examples, **When** team shows integration patterns, **Then** stakeholders see how components work with Configurator architecture

---

### User Story 3 - Component Developer Documents Migration Work (Priority: P3)

A component developer needs to document the business logic transformation process by creating Storybook stories that show before/after states, explain architectural changes, and provide integration examples for other developers to follow.

**Why this priority**: Documentation of the migration process helps scale the effort and provides templates for future component transformations. It also builds institutional knowledge about architectural patterns.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new component story, documenting the migration process, and verifying that other developers can understand and replicate the transformation approach.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a migrated component, **When** developer creates Storybook documentation, **Then** the story includes baseline comparison, transformation notes, and integration examples
2. **Given** transformation documentation, **When** other developers review it, **Then** they can understand the migration patterns and apply them to other components
3. **Given** component integration examples, **When** developers implement them, **Then** they successfully integrate components with Configurator architecture

### Edge Cases

- What happens when components have complex business logic that doesn't render well in Storybook?
- How does the system handle components that require authentication or specific Configurator context?
- What happens when DAISY v1 components have dependencies that can't be mocked in Storybook?
- How are components documented when their business logic transformation is incomplete?
- What happens when component examples require external APIs or services?
- How does the Storybook handle responsive design and different viewport testing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
