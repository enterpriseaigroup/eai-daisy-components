# Tasks: Public Storybook Deployment

**Input**: Design documents from `.specify/specs/002-storybook-deployment/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Architecture Note**: This repository provides complete DAISY v1 component copies (visual + usage + business logic) in `/daisyv1/` directory and visual-only V2 components based on shadcn/elevenlabs baseline, packaged as NPM components. Business logic integration with Configurator public APIs is added in later development phases.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Repository structure**: Visual component library with NPM package documentation site
- **Storybook files**: `.storybook/`, `stories/`, `.github/workflows/`
- **Component organization**: `daisyv1/` (complete DAISY v1 components), `src/` (visual-only V2 components), `stories/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Critical Path (Sequential Dependencies)

1. **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2**: Setup must complete before foundational work
2. **Phase 2 ‚Üí All User Stories**: Foundational infrastructure blocks all user story work
3. **US1 ‚Üí US2**: Basic component structure needed before V1 to V2 comparisons
4. **US2 ‚Üí US3**: Showcase features inform documentation tool requirements

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 1 (Setup)**:

- T003, T004, T006, T007 can run in parallel after T001, T002

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational)**:

- T009, T010, T013, T014, T015 can run in parallel after T008

**Within User Story 1**:
