# Research: Public Storybook Deployment

**Feature**: 002-storybook-deployment  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Complete  

## Technical Decisions

### Decision: Storybook 7.x Framework
**Rationale**: Storybook 7.x provides robust documentation features, automatic component discovery, and excellent GitHub Pages deployment support. The latest version includes improved performance, better TypeScript support, and enhanced accessibility testing tools.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Docusaurus: More complex setup, less component-focused
- GitBook: Limited interactivity for component examples
- Custom documentation site: Significant development overhead

### Decision: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
**Rationale**: GitHub Actions provides seamless integration with GitHub Pages, automatic deployment triggers, and built-in support for Storybook deployment workflows. Cost-effective for public repositories.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Netlify: Additional service dependency, overkill for static site
- Vercel: Similar to Netlify, adds complexity
- Manual deployment: Not scalable, prone to errors

### Decision: TypeScript for Configuration
**Rationale**: TypeScript provides type safety for Storybook configuration, story definitions, and component props documentation. Ensures consistency with the component library's TypeScript implementation.

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript configuration: Less type safety, harder to maintain
- Mixed approach: Inconsistent developer experience

## Component Organization Strategy

### Decision: Dual Category Structure (DAISY v1 vs Configurator)
**Rationale**: Clear separation allows for easy comparison between baseline and migrated components. Supports migration progress tracking and stakeholder demonstrations of transformation work.

**Implementation approach**:
- `/stories/daisyv1/` - Baseline components with original business logic
- `/stories/configurator/` - Migrated components with Configurator architecture
- `/stories/shared/` - Common utilities and documentation

### Decision: Migration Progress Tracking
**Rationale**: Visual indicators help stakeholders understand migration status and provide developers with clear roadmap visibility.

**Implementation approach**:
- Component metadata tags for migration status
- Progress dashboard in Storybook welcome page
- Color-coded status indicators in component navigation

## Deployment Strategy

### Decision: GitHub Pages with Custom Domain
**Rationale**: GitHub Pages provides reliable hosting for static sites with automatic SSL certificates. Custom domain maintains professional appearance for public documentation.

**Implementation approach**:
- Deploy from dedicated `gh-pages` branch
- Automated builds on main branch updates
- Custom domain configuration for branded URL

### Decision: Visual Regression Testing
**Rationale**: Automated visual testing ensures component rendering consistency across updates and prevents regression in component appearance during migration work.

**Implementation approach**:
- Chromatic integration for visual regression testing
- Automated screenshot comparison in CI pipeline
- Approval workflow for intentional visual changes

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
**Rationale**: Large component libraries can impact initial load times. Code splitting ensures fast initial page loads while maintaining full functionality.

**Implementation approach**:
- Lazy load component stories on demand
- Separate bundles for DAISY v1 and Configurator components
- Optimized asset loading for static resources

### Decision: Static Asset Optimization
**Rationale**: Optimized images and assets improve load times and user experience, especially important for public-facing documentation.

**Implementation approach**:
- Compressed images and icons
- Optimized font loading
- Minified CSS and JavaScript bundles

## Accessibility and Testing

### Decision: Automated Accessibility Testing
**Rationale**: Public documentation must meet accessibility standards. Automated testing ensures compliance and provides clear feedback on accessibility issues.

**Implementation approach**:
- Storybook accessibility addon integration
- Automated a11y testing in CI pipeline
- Accessibility status indicators in component documentation

### Decision: Cross-Browser Testing
**Rationale**: Public documentation must work consistently across different browsers and devices.

**Implementation approach**:
- Browser testing in CI pipeline
- Responsive design validation
- Performance testing across different network conditions
